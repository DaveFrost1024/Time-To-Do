# Time-To-Do

A tiny linux application with a bare bone stop watch and a clock that tracks how long you've got to live based on the average life expectancy and date of birth you enter in the preference, because who wouldn't want to be constantly reminded when they will die?

The plan is to expand the functionality so this program can do some time tracking and to do list functionality in the future.
